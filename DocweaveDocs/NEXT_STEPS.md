# Suggested Next Steps

1. Verify that DocWeave's actual code matches the new documentation claims about detection-only + heuristics fallback
2. Test the health check and copilot/check endpoints mentioned to ensure they work as documented
3. Consider updating any related documentation (README, installation guides) that may still reference the old overstated capabilities
4. Verify Copilot integration endpoints and authentication work correctly end-to-end
5. Test commit analysis feature against various repository structures and commit message formats
