# Suggested Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive CLI documentation replacing the deleted webapp guides (usage examples, command reference, shell integration)
2. Verify all CLI functionality is complete and test across macOS, Linux, and Windows with different shells
3. Update README and onboarding materials to reflect CLI-first approach and provide quick-start examples
4. Clarify intent with the commit author - does the app now support GitHub URLs or was this an accidental removal of important validation?
5. If intentional: add comprehensive error handling upstream to catch invalid URLs and provide user-friendly guidance, since validation was removed
