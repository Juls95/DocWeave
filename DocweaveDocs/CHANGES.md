## Commit 1: Docs updated

**SHA:** `f199e0b`  
**Author:** Julian Ramirez  
**Date:** 2026-02-15 15:15:52  
**Changes:** +116 / -89 lines  

### Summary

Documentation restructure that fundamentally clarifies DocWeave's actual Copilot CLI integration, shifting from overstating capabilities (claimed per-commit AI analysis, auto-generated diagrams, narratives) to accurately describing it as CLI detection with enhanced heuristics. Entire "How DocWeave Uses Copilot" section rewritten to be honest about limitations.

### Why This Change?

The original documentation made false claims about DocWeave's Copilot integration (programmatic invocation for analysis, diagram generation, narrative creation) that contradicted actual implementation. This correction prevents user disappointment and establishes trust by setting accurate expectations. Improves UX with reorganized setup flow and better troubleshooting guidance.

### Importance: HIGH

### Files Changed

- `COPILOT_SETUP.md`
- `QUICK_START.md`
- `development_guide.md`

### Suggested Next Steps

- Verify that DocWeave's actual code matches the new documentation claims about detection-only + heuristics fallback
- Test the health check and copilot/check endpoints mentioned to ensure they work as documented
- Consider updating any related documentation (README, installation guides) that may still reference the old overstated capabilities

## Commit 2: Adding Copilot

**SHA:** `6c34fbf`  
**Author:** Julian Ramirez  
**Date:** 2026-02-15 14:36:32  
**Changes:** +688 / -188 lines  

### Summary

Adds GitHub Copilot CLI integration to DocWeave with a new commit analysis feature, implemented across backend (copilot_integration.py, commit_analysis.py), frontend (app.js), and configuration (COPILOT_SETUP.md). This represents a strategic expansion of DocWeave's capabilities within the GitHub Copilot CLI ecosystem.

### Why This Change?

Integrating with GitHub Copilot CLI enables DocWeave to function as a specialized agent within the Copilot CLI environment, allowing AI-assisted commit analysis and documentation generation. This aligns with the CLI-first pivot and positions DocWeave as a developer productivity tool that enhances the Copilot workflow. The commit analysis feature specifically enables intelligent interpretation of git history, supporting the core DocWeave mission of documentation generation from code changes.

## Commit 3: Implementing CLI Docweave instead Webapp

**SHA:** `0c640dc`  
**Author:** Julian Ramirez  
**Date:** 2026-02-15 14:10:09  
**Changes:** +761 / -97 lines  

### Summary

Major architectural pivot removing web application infrastructure (generated docs, installation guides) to shift DocWeave from a web-based documentation generator to a CLI-first tool. This eliminates the webapp documentation generation pipeline in favor of GitHub Copilot CLI integration.

### Why This Change?

Business shift to focus on CLI-based developer tooling (GitHub Copilot CLI extension) rather than a standalone web application. CLI approach reduces deployment complexity, improves developer workflow integration, and aligns with Copilot's command-line environment. The webapp docs generation system is no longer needed in this new architecture.

- `src/docweave/cli.py`
- *... and 2 more files*

### Suggested Next Steps

- Update README and documentation to reflect CLI-first positioning and remove webapp references
- Create new CLI installation/usage guide replacing the deleted INSTALLATION.md
- Verify all CLI commands work end-to-end and test integration with GitHub Copilot
- Add migration guidance for any existing webapp users
- Update deployment/build pipeline to remove web server dependencies

## Commit 4: Adding instructions

**SHA:** `b98dea4`  
**Author:** Julian Ramirez  
**Date:** 2026-02-15 13:39:30  
**Changes:** +381 / -5 lines  

### Summary

Removed GitHub URL validation checks, helpful error messages, user guidance, and tutorial features from both backend and frontend. The commit message 'Adding instructions' contradicts the diff, which shows comprehensive removal of instructional content and user-facing helpers.

### Why This Change?

Unclear - the commit message contradicts the actual changes. The diff removes helpful error messages, validation, and guidance that assisted users with common issues (cloning repos, path resolution, git initialization). This appears to either be a mislabeled commit, a regression, or preparation for unimplemented GitHub URL support. The removal of tutorial/guide functions suggests intentional deprecation, but without replacement.

### Importance: HIGH

### Files Changed

- `src/docweave/app.py`
- `static/app.js`
- `static/index.html`
- `static/styles.css`

### Suggested Next Steps

- Verify commit message accuracy - 'Adding instructions' contradicts the removal of all instructional content and error guidance
- Test that backend error handling gracefully handles edge cases that previously had helpful guidance (non-existent paths, invalid repos)
- Assess UX impact - users will now receive minimal error messages without context or suggestions for resolution
- If GitHub URL support is intended, implement server-side handling for github.com URLs; if deprecated, document the change clearly

## Commit 5: Adding Copilot

**SHA:** `a25b130`  
**Author:** Julian Ramirez  
**Date:** 2026-02-11 21:17:48  
**Changes:** +473 / -110 lines  

### Summary

Deleted comprehensive COPILOT_SETUP.md and simplified README.md Copilot CLI documentation from 30+ detailed lines to 3 lines, reducing setup complexity but potentially creating gaps in troubleshooting and verification guidance.

### Why This Change?

Appears to streamline onboarding by removing redundant setup documentation and simplifying the installation instructions, shifting from 'optional but recommended' to a more implicit integration. However, this removes valuable troubleshooting steps, authentication options (PAT), verification methods, and security/privacy documentation that new users may need.

### Importance: HIGH

### Files Changed

- `COPILOT_SETUP.md`
- `README.md`
- `src/docweave/app.py`
- `src/docweave/components/copilot_integration.py`
- `src/docweave/features/commit_analysis.py`
- `static/app.js`

### Suggested Next Steps

- Clarify whether Copilot CLI is now a hard requirement vs optional - the truncated diff suggests removal of 'graceful fallback' mechanisms which changes project dependencies
- Verify if simplified 3-line installation is sufficient for all users and platforms, or if users will struggle without troubleshooting guides (especially the PATH/authentication sections that were removed)
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md and any developer setup documentation if Copilot CLI installation/configuration complexity has fundamentally changed

## Commit 6: first commit

**SHA:** `be49781`  
**Author:** Julian Ramirez  
**Date:** 2026-02-11 19:34:55  
**Changes:** +1673 / -0 lines  

### Summary

Initial commit introducing foundational documentation for DocWeave's GitHub Copilot CLI integration, including setup/verification guides and change documentation. Establishes user onboarding and authentication workflows for the AI-powered analysis system.

### Why This Change?

DocWeave requires the standalone Copilot CLI for AI-powered commit analysis and diagram generation. Users need explicit setup, authentication, and troubleshooting guidance to successfully install and verify the dependency before using the tool. This documentation is critical for adoption and reduces support burden.

### Importance: HIGH

### Files Changed

- `.cursorrules`
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- `development_guide.md`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/docweave/__init__.py`
- `src/docweave/app.py`
- `src/docweave/cli.py`
- `src/docweave/components/__init__.py`
- `src/docweave/components/copilot_integration.py`
- *... and 9 more files*

### Suggested Next Steps

- Test Copilot CLI installation methods across macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), Linux, and Windows to ensure all paths work correctly
- Add comprehensive CLI command reference documentation covering all docweave analyze options, output formats, and integration with CI/CD
- Implement automated health checks and fallback mechanisms to gracefully handle Copilot CLI unavailability with clear error messaging
