## Commit 1: GitIgnore modifies and readme improved

**SHA:** `fadc4ed`  
**Author:** Julian Ramirez  
**Date:** 2026-02-15 18:54:02  
**Changes:** +7 / -162 lines  

### Summary

Added `.cursorrules` configuration file to enforce development standards and significantly enhanced README with Copilot CLI integration details, fallback behavior explanation, and documentation of output formats. This establishes clear coding conventions and removes adoption barriers by clarifying the tool works without Copilot CLI.

### Why This Change?

The project needed standardized development guidelines for consistent code quality (type hints, functional programming, naming conventions) that can be leveraged by AI tools like Cursor IDE. The README improvements address user concerns about Copilot CLI dependency and provide clearer value proposition with detailed examples of generated documentation and use cases, reducing onboarding friction and increasing adoption.

### Importance: MEDIUM

### Files Changed

- `.cursorrules`
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`

### Suggested Next Steps

- Verify team members are aware of .cursorrules standards and incorporate them into code review practices
- Test README examples end-to-end to ensure accuracy of installation and usage instructions
- Monitor whether AI tools properly read and apply .cursorrules conventions in code generation tasks
