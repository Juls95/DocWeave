## Commit 1: Docs generate by Copilot

**SHA:** `3791ae8`  
**Author:** Julian Ramirez  
**Date:** 2026-02-15 15:35:17  
**Changes:** +292 / -263 lines  

### Summary

Removed detailed documentation for two significant commits (Copilot integration and documentation cleanup) from CHANGES.md, renumbering remaining commits and slightly condensing their descriptions. This appears to be an auto-generated update that eliminates historical change records without preserving context.

### Why This Change?

Auto-generated documentation refresh (suggested by commit message 'Docs generate by Copilot'), likely to simplify the changelog or reflect repository history reorganization. However, the removal of substantive commit analysis (especially the high-importance Copilot integration and docs correction commits) suggests either incomplete regeneration logic or intentional pruning of outdated change records.

### Importance: HIGH

### Files Changed

- `DocweaveDocs/CHANGES.md`
- `DocweaveDocs/DIAGRAMS.md`
- `DocweaveDocs/INTEGRATION.md`
- `DocweaveDocs/NARRATIVE.md`
- `DocweaveDocs/NEXT_STEPS.md`

### Suggested Next Steps

- Verify whether commits f199e0b and 6c34fbf still exist in git history or were rebased/squashed - if they exist, their removal from CHANGES.md breaks historical traceability
- Review the auto-generation logic/template for CHANGES.md to ensure it's capturing all significant commits and producing complete analysis (removed entries contained critical context about Copilot integration and documentation accuracy corrections)
- Restore or externally archive the removed commit analyses if they document important architectural decisions, especially the Copilot CLI integration feature which appears to be a core capability
