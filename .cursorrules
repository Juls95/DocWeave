# Project Rules
## Stack and Technologies

* Language: Python 3.10+ + Poetry for dependencies + Click for CLI

* Libraries: GitPython for repo interaction, Subprocess for Copilot CLI calls, Pytest for testing

* Always use async/await for I/O operations, never callbacks

* Prefer composition over inheritance

* Nomenclature: snake_case for variables and functions, CamelCase for classes and types

## Folder Structure

* src/
  - components/ → reusable modules
  - features/ → business logic by feature (e.g., commit analysis)
  - lib/ → general utilities
  - hooks/ → custom scripts (e.g., git hooks)
  - types/ → type hint definitions (if needed)

## Code Rules

* Always type everything with type hints (no implicit Any)

* Use early returns

* Prefer functional programming + pure functions, avoid classes where possible

* Commits in English, conventional commits format
